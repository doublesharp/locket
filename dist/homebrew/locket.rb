# Homebrew formula draft for the Locket CLI.
#
# This is a build-from-source formula. Until the offline release-signing
# ceremony (see docs/agents/progress.md, release-key-offline) ships, the
# tap is not production-ready and the SHA256 below is a placeholder.
#
# See dist/homebrew/README.md for the intended tap path and the release-tag
# to formula update flow.

  def caveats
    <<~CAVEATS
      Locket Homebrew packaging is a working draft.

      Until the offline release-signing ceremony ships, this formula is
      published from a personal tap rather than homebrew-core. Production
      tap status depends on the release-key-offline roadmap item.

      Locket is local-first: it stores secrets in an encrypted vault on this
      machine. CI and production secrets should use platform-native stores.
