# Locket Planned Implementation Spec

This spec describes the app Locket is intended to become. It is a pre-development target, not documentation for an existing shipped product. Normative terms such as `must`, `should`, and `may` describe requirements for future implementation and release readiness.

The Locket spec is split by implementation boundary. These files are normative as a set; do not duplicate rules across files. When behavior crosses boundaries, the owning file should hold the rule and other files should link to it.

## Freshness Baseline

Last reviewed: 2026-04-29.

Initial implementation should start from current stable foundations, not legacy defaults:

- Rust 2024 edition with the repository-pinned stable toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml` (`1.94.0` at this review). Reference: [Rust 1.85 / Rust 2024](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/20/Rust-1.85.0/).
- Tauri v2 for the desktop app and tray surface; start from the latest stable v2 minor at scaffolding time (`2.10.x` at this review), not legacy v1 or beta/RC APIs. Reference: [Tauri v2 releases](https://tauri.app/release/tauri/v2.10.1/).
- SLSA v1.2-style provenance expectations for release artifacts. Reference: [SLSA v1.2 build requirements](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.2/build-requirements).
- OWASP secrets-management guidance for lifecycle, rotation, audit, redaction, and CI boundaries. Reference: [OWASP Secrets Management Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html).
- NIST SP 800-63-4 guidance for local user verification and syncable authenticator/passkey tradeoffs. Reference: [NIST SP 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html).

Before the first public release, refresh this section against primary sources and update dependency versions, release signing, and platform-authenticator assumptions. Prefer current stable releases over release candidates unless a written design note explains the risk and migration plan.

## Ownership Guide

- Product, invariants, architecture, and data model define system-wide constraints.
- Storage, crypto, audit, errors, and agent specs define security-critical implementation contracts.
- CLI, policy, runtime, integrations, desktop, and scan specs define user-facing behavior.
- Engineering, testing, fuzzing, performance, diagnostics, and distribution specs define implementation quality gates and operational behavior.
