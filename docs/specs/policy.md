# Policy Authoring

This file is part of the normative planned Locket implementation spec. Start at [index.md](index.md).

## Policy Authoring

Policy authoring must be usable from CLI and UI without hand-editing TOML for common cases.

Commands:

```bash
locket policy add dev -- pnpm dev
locket policy allow dev DATABASE_URL
locket policy require dev DATABASE_URL
locket policy edit dev
locket policy delete dev
locket policy doctor
```

Behavior:

- `policy add` creates a structured `argv` command by default.
- `policy allow` permits optional secret access.
- `policy require` marks a secret as required before spawn.
- `policy edit` opens the configured editor on the policy file or launches the UI editor.
- `policy delete <name>` shows a metadata-only summary of affected shell hooks, tray actions, automation clients, and VS Code tasks, requires typed confirmation of the policy name, removes the saved policy, revokes live grants for that policy, and writes a `POLICY_UPDATE` audit row with deletion metadata.
- `policy doctor` validates command existence, required secrets, profile availability, dangerous-profile confirmations, and `lk://` references. If the agent is unavailable, it warns that `lk://` reference validation was skipped, lists unvalidated references, and exits with a distinct non-zero status separate from ordinary policy validation failure.
- UI policy editing must expose argv vs shell mode clearly and warn when shell mode is selected.
- Docker/Compose policy editing must expose `allow_remote_docker` clearly. The default is `false`; enabling it requires typed confirmation because remote Docker contexts deliver local secrets to another machine.
- Monorepos may define path-scoped environment sets under `[paths."<project-relative-directory>"]`. The current working directory is resolved under the project root, the deepest matching path scope wins, and its `required_secrets` / `optional_secrets` are merged into the selected command policy before policy execution, external-env resolution, `env inspect`, Docker, or Compose preparation. A scope may set `profile = "<profile>"` to use that profile for executions from the matching subtree. Path keys must be project-relative and must not contain `..` or absolute roots.
- Projects may define secret-level ACLs under `[secrets.<SECRET_NAME>]`. ACLs never grant access by themselves; they only narrow access already requested by `required_secrets` or `optional_secrets`. Supported fields are `allow_commands`, `allow_argv`, and `allow_paths`. If more than one field is present, every configured dimension must match before the secret can be delivered.

Example:

```toml
[commands.dev]
argv = ["pnpm", "dev"]

[paths."apps/api"]
profile = "dev"
required_secrets = ["DATABASE_URL"]
optional_secrets = ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"]

[paths."apps/web"]
required_secrets = ["NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL"]

[secrets.DATABASE_URL]
allow_commands = ["dev", "npm:dev"]
allow_argv = [["pnpm", "dev"], ["npm", "run", "dev"]]
allow_paths = ["apps/api/**"]
```

Command ACL semantics:

- `allow_commands` matches the saved policy name for `locket run <policy>` and the generated runner identity for adapter invocations such as `npm:dev`, `pnpm:test`, `cargo:test`, or `make:deploy`.
- `allow_argv` matches structured argv tokens only. `*` matches within one token, so `release:*` matches `release:prod`; `**` may appear as a whole token to match the remaining argv tail, such as `["cargo", "test", "**"]`.
- `allow_argv` does not match `shell = "..."` policies because shell strings are not parsed into trusted argv tokens. Use `allow_commands` for shell policies, and keep high-risk secrets behind `confirm` or `require_user_verification`.
- `allow_paths` entries are project-relative. A plain entry such as `apps/api` matches that directory and descendants; `apps/api/**` is accepted as the explicit subtree form. Absolute paths and `..` are rejected.
- A `[secrets.<NAME>]` table with no ACL fields is invalid. Omitting the table means the secret has no extra command/path ACL beyond the selected policy and path scope.

Policy source of truth:

- Project command policies are canonical in `locket.toml` under `[commands.<name>]` so they can be reviewed in Git and shared with teammates without exporting secret values.
- Project path scopes are canonical in `locket.toml` under `[paths.<relative-path>]` so subproject env boundaries are reviewable without exporting secret values.
- Project secret ACLs are canonical in `locket.toml` under `[secrets.<SECRET_NAME>]` so per-secret command and path limits are reviewable without exporting secret values.
- The SQLite `command_policies` table stores a normalized local index/cache used by the agent, UI, tray, VS Code, and policy doctor.
- `policy add`, `policy allow`, `policy require`, `policy edit`, and `policy delete` update `locket.toml` first, then refresh the SQLite index in the same user-visible operation.
- If `locket.toml` and SQLite disagree, `locket.toml` wins after a successful parse; invalid TOML fails closed and leaves the prior SQLite index read-only for diagnostics only.
