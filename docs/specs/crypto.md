# Crypto, Key Management & User Verification

This file is part of the normative planned Locket implementation spec. Start at [index.md](index.md).

## Crypto & Key Management

Algorithms:

- AEAD: `XChaCha20-Poly1305`
- KDF: `Argon2id`
- RNG: `rand::rngs::OsRng`
- Key derivation: HKDF where subkeys are needed
- Fingerprints: profile-scoped HMAC-SHA256 of secret values
- Audit integrity: HMAC chain with a separate audit key
- Memory handling: `zeroize` and `secrecy`
- Device identity: Ed25519 for invite/export signatures and age-compatible X25519 recipients for sealing bundles
- Local user verification: platform biometric/presence APIs plus optional FIDO2/CTAP2 hardware-key presence

Cryptographic choices must use maintained RustCrypto, dalek, age/rage, or similarly reviewed implementations. The app must not introduce custom cryptographic primitives, custom KEMs, custom password hashing, or bespoke authenticated-encryption compositions.

Key hierarchy:

```text
Master Key (OS protected or recovered)
  -> HKDF key-wrap keys by project id and key purpose
    -> Wrapped random Project Metadata Key
    -> Wrapped random Project Audit Key
    -> Wrapped random Profile Secret Key per profile
    -> Wrapped random Profile Fingerprint Key per profile
  -> Profile Secret Key
    -> Secret/Data Encryption Key
  -> Profile Fingerprint Key
  -> Project Audit Key
```

Project metadata, project audit, profile secret, and profile fingerprint keys are random 32-byte keys stored only as wrapped material in the `keys` table. They are not deterministically derived from the master key. HKDF is used to derive purpose-separated wrapping keys from the master key, so wrapped keys can be independently rotated and audited without making one project/profile key substitutable for another.

HKDF wrap info v1:

```text
hkdf_wrap_info_v1 =
  "locket-wrap-v1" ASCII bytes
  u16_le(wrap_info_schema_version = 1)
  field("project_id", project_id)
  field("profile_id", profile_id or "")
  field("purpose", key_purpose)
```

`profile_id` is the empty string only for project-scoped keys. `key_purpose` is one of the canonical persisted purpose strings used by `keys.purpose`: `project-metadata`, `project-audit`, `profile-secret`, or `profile-fingerprint`. The Rust `KeyPurpose::Audit` variant serializes as `project-audit`. The `field(name, value)` helper uses the length-prefixed UTF-8 encoding defined for canonical AAD v1. HKDF info construction must never use raw concatenation, delimiters, JSON, TOML, or locale-sensitive encoding.

Profile key boundary:

- Secret values are encrypted under per-version DEKs; each DEK is wrapped by the active profile's `ProfileSecret` key, not by a project-wide secret key.
- Known-value scan fingerprints use the active profile's `ProfileFingerprint` key, not a project-wide fingerprint key.
- The project audit key signs the local audit chain and is not sufficient to decrypt secret values.
- Profile-scoped team invites and sealed bundles include only the selected profiles' `ProfileSecret` and `ProfileFingerprint` keys inside the encrypted bundle payload. Granting `dev` must not provide cryptographic access to `prod`.

Secret value encoding:

- v1 secret values are UTF-8 strings for environment-variable compatibility.
- NUL bytes are forbidden because OS environment variables cannot safely carry them.
- Multiline values are rejected by default in `set` and `import`; a future explicit multiline delivery mode may support them without changing the default env-injection contract.
- Docker, Compose, `exec`, `redact`, and scan paths must treat values as bytes after UTF-8 validation and must never perform locale-dependent normalization.

Encryption flow:

```text
secret value
  -> generate random DEK
  -> encrypt secret with DEK
  -> encrypt DEK with profile secret key
  -> store encrypted blob and encrypted DEK metadata
  -> store keyed fingerprint for the version
  -> append audit row with chained HMAC
```

AAD must bind ciphertext to at least project id, profile id, secret id, secret name, and version. AAD is re-derived deterministically from canonical metadata and the blob's AAD schema version; it is not read from a mutable database field. Renaming or moving a blob across projects/profiles must fail decryption.

AEAD nonce layout:

- `SecretBlob.value_nonce` is used only for encrypting the UTF-8 secret value with the per-version DEK.
- The DEK wrap uses a separate 24-byte nonce embedded as the first bytes of `SecretBlob.encrypted_dek`: `wrap_nonce || wrap_ciphertext`.
- Decryption code must split `encrypted_dek` before unwrapping the DEK. Reusing `value_nonce` for the DEK wrap is forbidden.

Key wrap v1:

```text
key_wrap_v1 =
  wrap_nonce: 24 random bytes
  wrap_ciphertext: XChaCha20-Poly1305(
    key = profile_secret_key or HKDF-derived wrapping key,
    nonce = wrap_nonce,
    plaintext = key material,
    aad = key_wrap_aad_v1
  )

key_wrap_aad_v1 =
  "locket-key-wrap-v1" ASCII bytes
  field("project_id", project_id)
  field("key_id", key_id or secret_id)
  field("profile_id", profile_id or "")
  u32_le(version or 0)
  field("purpose", key purpose or "secret-dek")
  u16_le(wrap_schema_version = 1)
```

Stored key-wrap layouts are intentionally different:

- `SecretBlob.encrypted_dek = wrap_nonce || wrap_ciphertext` because there is no separate nonce column for per-version DEK wraps.
- `keys.wrapped_material = wrap_ciphertext` and `keys.nonce = wrap_nonce` for wrapped project/profile keys.

The `field(name, value)` helper uses the same length-prefixed UTF-8 encoding defined for canonical AAD v1 below.

KDF parameters:

- Recovery envelope Argon2id parameters: memory `m=65536 KiB`, iterations `t=3`, parallelism `p=4`.
- Passphrase fallback Argon2id parameters: memory `m=32768 KiB`, iterations `t=2`, parallelism `p=4`.
- `recovery/kdf.toml` uses the following canonical TOML key names: `kdf_profile_id` (string, `lk_kdf_*` prefix), `algorithm` (string, `"argon2id"` for v1), `version` (integer, schema version of this file, `1` for v1), `salt` (string, unpadded base64url), `m_cost` (integer, memory in KiB), `t_cost` (integer, iterations), `p_cost` (integer, parallelism), `output_len` (integer, derived key length in bytes, `32` for v1), and `created_at` (integer, UTC Unix nanoseconds as `i64`). These names are normative; implementations must use them exactly for recovery interoperability. `kdf_profile_id` is an opaque random 128-bit id with prefix `lk_kdf_`, generated for each recovery envelope creation or recovery-code rotation. It is not derived from the recovery code, salt, device id, or project id. `kdf_profile_id` must match the id stored in `recovery/envelope.bin`; mismatch means the KDF file and envelope are not a valid pair and recovery fails closed.
- Recovery envelope re-wraps may upgrade KDF parameters but must never silently downgrade them. If the running binary cannot meet stored parameters, recovery fails closed with a typed error rather than using weaker parameters.
- Stored KDF parameters are authoritative for future recovery; the binary default is used only for new envelopes or explicit upgrades.

Canonical AAD v1:

```text
aad_v1 =
  "locket-aad-v1" ASCII bytes
  u16_le(aad_schema_version = 1)
  field("project_id", project_id)
  field("profile_id", profile_id)
  field("secret_id", secret_id)
  field("secret_name", secret_name)
  u32_le(version)

field(name, value) =
  u16_le(byte_len(name)) || UTF-8(name) ||
  u32_le(byte_len(value)) || UTF-8(value)
```

Opaque IDs are encoded as their canonical prefixed UTF-8 string form. `secret_name` is encoded exactly after validation and before any display transformation. Integers are little-endian. No JSON, TOML, locale-aware case folding, path normalization, or map ordering is involved in AAD. Any future field or encoding change must increment `aad_schema_version`.

OS key integration:

| OS | Backend |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | Keychain |
| Windows | Credential Manager / DPAPI-backed keyring |
| Linux | Secret Service |

Use a cross-platform `keyring` crate initially, wrapped behind a `locket-platform` trait. Provide an Argon2 passphrase fallback where OS key storage is unavailable.

Passphrase fallback must store only salt and KDF parameters, never a reusable verifier that can reveal the master key. KDF parameters must be recorded so they can be upgraded over time.

Recovery code model:

- Locket has one recovery secret: the recovery code.
- The recovery code is displayed once during initialization as exactly 160 random bits encoded as 32 Crockford Base32 data characters plus 2 checksum characters, grouped for paper entry. The checksum detects transcription errors; it does not add security entropy.
- The recovery code derives a recovery unwrap key with Argon2id and stored salt/KDF parameters.
- The local recovery envelope contains wrapped master key material and the local device private key material needed to import bundles addressed to that device.
- `locket recover` restores the OS keychain entry for the master key and the OS keychain-backed local device private key material from the recovery envelope.
- Sealed bundles require the recipient device private key to import. If that private key is lost, the recovery code can restore it only when the local recovery envelope is present; otherwise the user needs another trusted device or a fresh team invite.

Recovery envelope v1:

- `recovery/envelope.bin` is a versioned binary container. All integers are little-endian and all strings are UTF-8 length-prefixed.
- Header: magic bytes `LOCKET-RECOVERY\0`, `u16 schema_version = 1`, `field("kdf_profile_id", id)`, `i128 created_at_unix_nanos_utc`, `u32 entry_count`.
- Entry: `field("entry_kind", kind)`, `field("entry_id", id)`, `u16 algorithm_id`, `u16 nonce_len = 24`, `nonce`, `u32 ciphertext_len`, `ciphertext`.
- `algorithm_id = 1` means XChaCha20-Poly1305.
- The recovery unwrap root is `Argon2id(recovery_code, recovery/kdf.toml.salt, stored params)`.
- Each entry encryption key is `HKDF-SHA256(recovery_unwrap_root, info = "locket-recovery-entry-v1" || field("entry_kind", entry_kind) || field("entry_id", entry_id) || field("kdf_profile_id", kdf_profile_id))`.
- Each entry AAD is `locket-recovery-envelope-v1 || u16_le(schema_version) || field("kdf_profile_id", kdf_profile_id) || field("entry_kind", entry_kind) || field("entry_id", entry_id)`.
- Required wrapped entries are `master_key`, `device_signing_private_key`, and `device_sealing_private_key`; Locket-managed automation client private keys may be included as `automation_client_private_key:<client_id>` entries.
- `locket client create` with `--storage os-keychain` or `--storage wrapped-local-file` writes the client private key wrap into the recovery envelope during creation. `locket recovery rotate` re-wraps all active managed client private keys under the new recovery code in the same atomic replacement as the master and device key wraps; revoked clients are omitted from the new envelope.
- Externally managed automation client keys are not represented in the recovery envelope and are never recovered by Locket.

Passkey and local user-verification model:

- General user-presence gates use platform APIs directly: macOS LocalAuthentication.framework, Windows Hello user-consent APIs, and Linux desktop Secret Service or configured hardware-key presence where available.
- Hardware security keys use CTAP2/FIDO2 user-presence/user-verification flows directly for approval gates.
- Browser-style WebAuthn/passkey ceremonies are not the default path for local CLI/UI user presence because they add browser/RP ceremony without improving the local approval primitive.
- WebAuthn PRF/hmac-secret is allowed only as an optional key-wrapping factor when a hardware token or platform authenticator supports it. Recovery code support remains mandatory because PRF availability and synced-passkey behavior vary by platform.
- Local user-verification gates can protect unlock, reveal/copy, dangerous-profile switching, team invite acceptance, device registration, and recovery operations.
- Locket stores only public metadata for authenticators and never stores passkey, authenticator, or biometric private material.
- Local user verification does not replace peer-credential checks for the local agent and does not bypass policy, grants, audit, or team roles.
- Registration, removal, and authentication write audit rows when project context is available.

Component checks:

- Decryption fails with wrong key, nonce, AAD, project, profile, secret id, secret name, or version.
- Fingerprints are keyed HMACs, not raw hashes.
- Audit verification detects row deletion, insertion, reordering, or mutation.

## Local User Verification And Passkeys

Local user verification is the default approval layer for sensitive Locket actions. It must use platform presence APIs, not browser-style WebAuthn ceremonies.

Default approval paths:

- macOS: LocalAuthentication.framework.
- Windows: Windows Hello user-consent APIs.
- Linux: Secret Service unlock prompts or configured hardware-key presence where available.
- Hardware keys: CTAP2/FIDO2 user-presence or user-verification flows directly.

Protected use cases:

- Unlocking the vault with local user verification.
- Requiring presence/verification before reveal, copy, recovery, dangerous-profile switch, team invite acceptance, or device registration.
- Strengthening team trust ceremonies by requiring local presence at invite acceptance or device registration.
- Optionally using WebAuthn PRF/hmac-secret as an additional key-wrapping factor when a supported authenticator is explicitly registered.

Rules:

- Local user verification never replaces recovery codes.
- Local user verification never bypasses project/profile policy, grants, team roles, or audit logging.
- Biometric, authenticator, and passkey private material is never stored by Locket.
- Browser-style WebAuthn/passkey ceremonies are not used for ordinary reveal/copy/unlock approvals. They may be used only for optional PRF/hmac-secret key-wrapping flows that require a WebAuthn-compatible authenticator.
- For optional WebAuthn PRF credentials, the relying party id must be recorded in `PasskeyCredential.webauthn_relying_party_id` and must never change silently. The default RP ID for that optional path is `locket.localhost`; official signed distributions may define a controlled RP ID only as an explicit migration requiring credential re-registration.
- Synced passkeys are not accepted as a sole recovery or trust root. If a platform exposes backup eligibility/state, Locket must display it so teams can decide whether synced credentials are acceptable as an extra approval factor under current NIST syncable-authenticator guidance.
- Authenticator metadata is safe metadata, but credential ids and public keys should not be printed unless explicitly requested.
