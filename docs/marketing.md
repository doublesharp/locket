# Describing Locket

Updated 2026-10-18. Keep product copy consistent with the shipped workflow and its acceptance limits. The README and user guides should make the first successful run easy to find.

## The pitch

> Replace development `.env` files with an encrypted local vault. Approve which variables a command can receive, then run your app.

Locket keeps values encrypted on your machine and injects approved names into the process you start. Project configuration can describe required variables and public defaults without containing secret values. Local execution needs no hosted service once the vault, keys and project configuration are available.

For teams, one owner publishes signed, device-encrypted updates through a folder the team already shares. Each developer keeps personal overrides and approves command access locally. First join requires comparing full device and owner fingerprints through a separate trusted channel.

## Show the workflow

Lead with importing an existing development file and running one command. Link to the [README quick start](../README.md#quick-start) for the current commands. Explain variable contracts when a developer needs to configure a fresh clone, and introduce [team onboarding](team-updates.md) when they need to share values.

The desktop supports import and durable command editing through the unlocked agent, including passphrase-only vaults. Readiness should explain what needs attention before execution. Advanced audit, recovery and policy controls belong after the first successful run.

## Claims that need care

- Redaction and scanning are explicit tools. They do not intercept arbitrary AI requests or guarantee that a credential never leaves a process. Code that receives a value can disclose it.
- Folder delivery encrypts contents for approved devices. The provider can still observe metadata, withhold updates or delete files. Status reports the last verified update, not global freshness.
- Removing a device cannot erase values it already received. Rotate credentials at their providers after offboarding.
- Signed team delivery is implemented and tested with independent synthetic stores. Real provider delivery, independent human fingerprint comparisons and observed onboarding still need acceptance runs.
- Owner handover and trust-fork recovery are unsupported. Do not suggest resetting a pin to silence a warning.
- Unsigned package checks do not establish release signing, notarization or clean-machine usability. Follow the [distribution guide](distribution-validation.md) and [signing setup report](release-signing-setup.md).
- Do not publish proposed pricing, hosted tiers, SSO, compliance certifications, market-size estimates or performance numbers as current product facts.

## Voice

Use concrete actions and examples: import, approve, run, share and resolve. Explain the benefit before the architecture. Describe limits where they affect a decision. Avoid guarantees such as “secrets never leak,” unmeasured speed claims and unsupported competitor comparisons.

The [comparison page](comparison.md) describes the current workflow. Keep external comparisons tied to primary sources and verify changing facts before publication. A useful adoption result is an unfamiliar developer completing their first run and helping a teammate join without coaching; source tests alone do not establish that result.
